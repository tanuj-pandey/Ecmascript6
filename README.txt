ES6 is a feature set provided on top of the javascript library to provide developers with a collection of awesome new features.  
ES6 will make your code clean and concise, and it will make your life easier as a developer.  
It also has additional functions and features that were not even possible in prior versions of javascript.  
A majority of the latest browsers now support most, but not all, of the ES6 features.  
Keep that in mind since most web applications are compiled using Babel.js to provide support for all browsers and older version of browsers.

A majority of the latest libraries and frameworks are now being written in ES6, so you don't want to get left behind.
